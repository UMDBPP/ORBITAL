7.2V to 6V DC/DC Converter:
	- Select Pin LOW = USB input is priority. If priority input (USB) is not able to supply enough power, input two (battery becomes
	priority)
	- UVLO forces converter to stop accepting source power when input voltage dips below a user-defined limit 
		- Vturnoff= 1.22(1 + RT/RB)
		- For USB: Vturnoff = 4.7V -> RT = 350kOHM, RB = 100kOHM
		- For Battery: Vturnoff = 6.4V -> RT = 510kOHM, RB = 100kOHM
	- Output voltage is defined by user-set voltage divider:
		- Vout = 1 + (R1/R2)
		- We want Vout = 6V so R1 = 500kOHM and R2 = 100kOHM

6V to 3.3V DC/DC Converter:
	- Texas Instrument Chip -> Can generate optimized circuit design on TI website
	- Output voltage defined by resistor values:
		- Vout = .6(1 + (RT/RB))
		- 3.3V Output -> RT = 225kOHM, RB = 50kOHM

Stepper Motor:
	- Operates with 6V power supply
	- 4 pins connected to RP2040 for digital inputs:
		- D2 -> Mode 1
		- D3 -> Mode 2
		- D4 -> DIR/Mode 4
		- D5 -> STCK/Mode 3
	- See datasheet for how to program Mode pins to create desired step outputs
	- Other pins:
		- D6 -> EN/FLT
			- HIGH to enable motor
			- LOW to disable
			- IC automatically disables if a fault is reached (operating temperature too high, etc.)
		- D7 -> STBY/RESET
			- HIGH -> Normal consumption
			- LOW -> Low power consumption
			- SHOULD WE JUST TIE TO HIGH? OR DO WE WANT ABILITY FOR LOW CONSUMPTION?
		- A3 -> REF
			- Reference voltage for PWM circuitry
			- Personally not sure what this does, but operating conditions are .1V - .5V
	- Need to find external 4 pin out connection for 4 motor pin outputs

BMP:
	- For I2C Communication: 
		SDA -> GPIO 0
		SCLK -> GPIO 1
	- Follows typical datasheet application
