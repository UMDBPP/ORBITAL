7.2V to 6V DC/DC Converter:
	- Select Pin LOW = USB input is priority. If priority input (USB) is not able to supply enough power, input two (battery becomes
	priority)
	- UVLO forces converter to stop accepting source power when input voltage dips below a user-defined limit 
		- Vturnoff= 1.22(1 + RT/RB)
		- For USB: Vturnoff = 4.7V -> RT = 350kOHM, RB = 100kOHM
		- For Battery: Vturnoff = 6.4V -> RT = 510kOHM, RB = 100kOHM
	- Output voltage is defined by user-set voltage divider:
		- Vout = 1 + (R1/R2)
		- We want Vout = 6V so R1 = 500kOHM and R2 = 100kOHM

6V to 3.3V DC/DC Converter:
	- Texas Instrument Chip -> Can generate optimized circuit design on TI website
	- Output voltage defined by resistor values:
		- Vout = .6(1 + (RT/RB))
		- 3.3V Output -> RT = 225kOHM, RB = 50kOHM

Stepper Motor:
	- Operates with 6V power supply
	- 4 pins connected to RP2040 for digital inputs:
		- D2 -> Mode 1
		- D3 -> Mode 2
		- D4 -> DIR/Mode 4
		- D5 -> STCK/Mode 3
	- See datasheet for how to program Mode pins to create desired step outputs
	- Other pins:
		- EN/FLT -> Set to HIGH
		- STBY/RESET -> Set to HIGH
	- Setting VRef:
		- Motors are rated .6A
		- VRef = Rsnsx * Iload
		- Typical application values for Rsnsx -> 330 mOhm
		- Results in a Vref = .2V
		- Supply via RP2040 1.1V output (voltage divider)
	- Need to find external 4 pin out connection for 4 motor pin outputs

BMP:
	- For I2C Communication: 
		SDA -> GPIO 0
		SCLK -> GPIO 1
	- Follows typical datasheet application

Raspberry PI Reset:
	- 

Flash:
	- Connected to RP2040 based on datasheet specifications
	- Is there a specific solder jumper that we want to use?

SD Card:
	- Currently hooked up to RP2040 via SPi
	- See: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/278852/sd-card-detect-in-spi-mode

GPS:
	- Are we sending correction data to GPS (RXD2_B / Pin26)?
	- Current Pin Connections with RP2040:
		- RXD_R (GPS Receiver) -> D8 (UART1 TX)
		- TXD_R (GPS Transmitter) -> D9 (UART1 RX)
	- Need 3.3 V from both standard and backup sources
	- Could also connect TXD_B, RXD_B
		- Specifically, does RXD_B need to be driven to high (3.3) when idle?
		- Or can we leave floating?
	- Based on typical GPS application from datasheet, most pins can be left floating/not-connected
